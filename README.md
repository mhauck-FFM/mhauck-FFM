### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
My name is Marius and I'm currently working as a Data Science consultant in Frankfurt/Main (Germany). Originally a meteorologist researching atmospheric dynamics way up in the stratosphere, I pursued my passion for wrangling and analyzing data to finally becoming a Data Scientist.
