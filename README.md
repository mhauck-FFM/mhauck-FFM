### Hi there! Long time no see. 👋
My name is Marius and I'm currently working as a Data Science and Data Engineering consultant in Frankfurt/Main (Germany). Originally a meteorologist researching fancy atmospheric dynamics way up in the stratosphere, I pursued my passion for wrangling and analyzing data to turn it into my career. Due to my background in both academia and industry, I provide more than 5 years of solid experience in:
  - data analysis
  - BI tools
  - numerical modeling
  - stochastics/statistics
  - communicating data and science to a broad audience (as well as, of course, atmospheric sciences)

Recently, I've been intensively working on these topics to deepen my knowledge even further:
  - data wrangling and analyses
  - all things BI (mostly Power BI & Tableau) and data visualization (Streamlit!)
  - cloud solutions (after all, still meteorologist)
  - big data tools
  - and many more yet to come
  
### Tools and Skills
Over the years, I have used many different tools and acquired a variety of skills. Here are the ones that matter most:
- **Programming Languages:** python, IDL, R, Fortran, SQL, CQL, bash (shell)
- **Python Libraries:** numpy/scipy, pandas, streamlit, pyspark, keras, tensorflow, ...
- **BI Tools**: Power BI, Tableau
- **Big Data Tools**: Databricks, Apache Spark, hdfs
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, Amazon Redshift
- **Cloud Providers:** Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/))
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **Visualization:** Dash, Streamlit
- **Others:** Docker, Apache Airflow, ...
 
### Recent Projects
Here are some of my projects I'm recently working on:
  - Stratospheric Dynamics (PhD project)
  - Data Warehouse on AWS Redshift ([here](https://github.com/mhauck-FFM/Udacity_Data_Engineering_Projects/tree/master/Project_7))
  - Simple Car Recognition Program ([here](https://github.com/mhauck-FFM/Car_Recognition))
  - Weather Scraper on AWS Lambda ([here](https://github.com/mhauck-FFM/Lambda_Weather_Scraper))
  - Classifying Reddit posts ([here](https://github.com/mhauck-FFM/Reddit_Post_Classifier))
  
I'm always excited to hear about new interesting projects! So let's connect via [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Marius_Hauck/cv).
