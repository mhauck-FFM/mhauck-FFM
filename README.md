### Hi there! Long time no see. ðŸ‘‹
My name is Marius and I'm currently working as a Data Science consultant in Frankfurt/Main (Germany). Originally a meteorologist researching fancy atmospheric dynamics way up in the stratosphere, I pursued my passion for wrangling and analyzing data to turn it into my career. Due to my background in both academia and industry, I provide more than 5 years of solid experience in:
  - data analysis and mining
  - numerical modeling
  - stochastics/statistics (as well as, of course, atmospheric sciences)
  - communicating data and science to a broad audience

Recently, I've been working on these topics to deepen my knowledge even further:
  - machine learning (especially deep learning)
  - data engineering ([Udacity Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027))
