### Hi there! Long time no see. ðŸ‘‹
My name is Marius and I'm currently working as a Data Science consultant in Frankfurt/Main (Germany). Originally a meteorologist researching fancy atmospheric dynamics way up in the stratosphere, I pursued my passion for wrangling and analyzing data to turn it into my career. Due to my background in both academia and industry, I provide more than 5 years of solid experience in:
  - data analysis and mining
  - numerical modeling
  - stochastics/statistics 
  - communicating data and science to a broad audience (as well as, of course, atmospheric sciences)

Recently, I've been intensively working on these topics to deepen my knowledge even further:
  - machine learning (especially deep learning)
  - data engineering ([Udacity Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027))
  - cloud solutions (after all, still meteorologist)
  - big data tools
  - and many more yet to come
  
 ### Tools and Skills
 Over the years, I have used many different tools and acquired a variety of skills. Here are the ones that matter most:
