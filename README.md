### Hi there! Long time no see. ðŸ‘‹
My name is Marius and I'm currently working as a Data Science consultant in Frankfurt/Main (Germany). Originally a meteorologist researching fancy atmospheric dynamics way up in the stratosphere, I pursued my passion for wrangling and analyzing data to turn it into my career. Due to my background in both academia and industry, I provide solid knowledge in:
  - data handling
  - data engineering
  - data analysis
  - stochastics
  - numerical methods
  (as well as, of course, atmospheric sciences)
